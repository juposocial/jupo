Jupo is publicly hosted at <http://play.jupo.com/>
and is also available for [download](https://github.com/juposocial/jupo/tags) 
for private installation.

Jupo is developed mainly using Python 2.6.6 and Python 2.7.2 on Mac OS X Mountain Lion and Ubuntu Precise. 
It is known to work on other Linux distributions. 
Jupo requires some additional libraries and packages that aren't distributed 
with Python ([see details](https://github.com/juposocial/jupo/blob/develop/requirements.txt)).
Efforts are made to keep Jupo compatible with Python 2.5.x but no guarantees are made.
